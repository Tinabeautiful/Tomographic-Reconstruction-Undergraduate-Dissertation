# Tomographic-Reconstruction-Undergraduate-Dissertation
This repository contains work that I did as my undergraduate dissertation. It consists of the code of the reconstruction algorithms that I developed in Python.

This code requires the following packages: AcquisitionGeometry, L2NormSquared, BlockFunction, MixedL21Norm, IndicatorBox, GradientOperator, BlockOperator, PDHG, ProjectionOperator, FBP, TomoPhantom, show2D, show_geometry, noise, matplotlib.pyplot and numpy.
